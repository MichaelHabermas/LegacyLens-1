# LBI Commands Reference

When working in this project, **check `.cursor/commands/lbi.lbi.md`** to know and use whatever LBI commands would be most useful for the current task.

## When to Consult

- **Before starting**: Read the file to see available slash commands and the workflow decision tree.
- **New features or specs**: Prefer the SDD workflow (`/lbi.request`, `/lbi.specify`, `/lbi.plan`, `/lbi.implement`, etc.) or the lite workflow for small changes (`/lbi.lite.request`, `/lbi.lite.plan`, `/lbi.lite.implement`).
- **Governance or architecture**: Use `/lbi.constitution`, `/lbi.architecture`, `/lbi.validate-constitution`, `/lbi.validate-architecture`.
- **QA or tests**: Use the QA workflow (`/lbi.qa.plan`, `/lbi.qa.tasks`, `/lbi.qa.implement`, etc.).
- **Product/PM work**: Use the PM workflow (`/lbi.pm.discover`, `/lbi.pm.prd`, `/lbi.pm.stories`, etc.).
- **CI/CD, security, or pre-deploy**: Use `/lbi.ci-setup`, `/lbi.security-setup`, `/lbi.preflight`, `/lbi.ready-to-push`.
- **Documentation or tasks**: Use `/lbi.docs`, `/lbi.document`, `/lbi.tasks`, `/lbi.checklist`.

## Action

When an LBI command would clearly help (e.g., planning, spec, review, push), **read the corresponding command file** under `.cursor/commands/` and follow its instructions. Prefer using the command’s workflow over ad-hoc steps.
